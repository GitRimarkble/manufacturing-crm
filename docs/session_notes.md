# Manufacturing System Development Session Notes

## 🚀 Session Overview
Date: [Current Date]
Focus: Product Routes Enhancement and Repository Setup

## 🔧 Key Implementations

### 1. Product Schema Improvements
- Added `description` field
- Added `price` field with automatic calculation
- Enhanced validation messages
- Added transform logic for price calculation with markup

### 2. Main Product Routes (`/api/products/route.ts`)
#### Added Features:
- Soft delete support
- Type-safe filtering
- Search functionality by name/description
- Low stock filtering
- Consistent error handling with NextResponse
- Proper field selection

### 3. Product ID Routes (`/api/products/[id]/route.ts`)
#### Improvements:
- Soft delete implementation
- Enhanced error handling
- ID validation
- Automatic price recalculation
- Proper field selection with related data
- Role-based access control

## 💡 Technical Details

### Price Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Automatic price calculation with 30% markup
price = (materialCost + laborCost) * 1.3
```

### Search and Filter Capabilities
- Type filtering (NEON, LED)
- Status filtering (ACTIVE, DISCONTINUED)
- Low stock alerts (stock <= 10)
- Text search in name and description

### Security Features
- Role-based access control
- Server-side session validation
- Soft delete for data integrity
- Input validation

## 🌐 Repository Setup
- Repository: https://github.com/GitRimarkble/manufacturing-crm.git
- Branch Structure: main branch
- Initial Commit: Enhanced product routes with validation and soft delete

## 📝 Code Changes Summary

### Product Schema
```typescript
export const productCreateSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters'),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  type: z.enum(['NEON', 'LED']),
  materialCost: z.number().min(0, 'Material cost must be non-negative'),
  laborCost: z.number().min(0, 'Labor cost must be non-negative'),
  price: z.number().min(0, 'Price must be non-negative'),
  status: z.enum(['ACTIVE', 'DISCONTINUED']).default('ACTIVE'),
  stock: z.number().int().min(0, 'Stock must be non-negative').default(0),
})
```

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive testing
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Enhance error logging
4. Consider adding bulk operations
5. Implement caching strategy

## 🔍 API Endpoints

- Validates updates

### DELETE /api/products/[id]
- Implements soft delete
- Records deletion timestamp
- Requires admin privileges
